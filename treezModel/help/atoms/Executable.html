		<h2>Executable</h2>
		
		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		
		The purpose of the <a class = "executable"></a> atom is to execute a system command, e.g. 
		<pre>"C:\windows\system32\mshta.exe" javascript:alert(42);close();</pre> 
		The system command typically consists of the path to an executable file and optional arguments (for input, output and logging). 
		
		<h3>Class name</h3>	
		
		org.treez.model.atom.executable.Executable; 
		
		<h3>Work flow</h3>
		
		You can start the <a class = "executable"></a> atom with 
		<ul>
			<li>the play button in the upper right corner of the property page,</li>
			<li>with the play button in the context menu or</li>
			<li>remotely with another atom (e.g. in a <a class="sweep"></a>).</li>
		</ul>
		
		The <a class = "executable"></a> will be executed in three steps: 
		
		<ol>
			<li>If it has <a class = "inputFileGenerator"></a> children, 
			those children are executed first. An input file that has been generated by an 
			<a class = "inputFileGenerator"></a> child can be referenced by the system command in the next step.  
			</li>
			<li>The system command is executed. If the executable writes text to the system
			output, this text will be logged to the Eclipse console.</li>
			<li>If the <a class = "executable"></a> atom has <a class = "tableImport"></a> children, 
			those children are executed. This allows to import data that has been generated by the execution 
			of the system command.   
			</li>
		</ol>
				
		<h3>Construction</h3>
		
		A new <a class = "executable"></a> is created by: 
		<ul>
			<li>using the context menu of a <a class="models"></a> atom or
			</li>
			<li>by calling the corresponding factory method of the <a class="models"></a> atom:	
			<pre class="prettyprint">Executable executable = models.createExecutable("executable");</pre>	     
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Arguments</h3>
		
		<h4>Executable</h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Executable</b>: The path to the <b>executable file</b>. This path will be automatically put in 
			<b>quotation marks</b> to ensure that paths that include spaces work correctly. Do not include additional
			arguments here but use the other input fields. The content of the other input fields will be appended 
			to the executable path (separated by spaces). You can have a look at the <b>status section</b> to see a
			preview of the <b>complete system command</b> that results from the content of all input fields.  
			</li>			
		</ul>
			
		
		<h4 id="input">Input</h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Input arguments</b>: First part for specifying input arguments. This is typically a <b>key word</b>
			that tells the executable that the specification of an input file will follow, e.g. "-i" or "-open". Leave 
			this empty if your executable does not require such an input key word. If you use <b>special characters</b>
			please check if you need to include escape characters, e.g. double slashes or quotation marks instead of
			single ones. Please consider this also for the other arguments.
			</li>
			<li><b>Input file or folder</b>: Second part for specifying input arguments. This is typically the path
			to an input file  or folder, e.g. "C:/input.txt". If the input file does not yet exist, you can manually 
			create it or use a <a class="inputFileGenerator"></a> atom to automatically generate the input file from a 
			<a class="genericInputModel"></a> before the system command is executed. This path will not automatically
			be put in quotation marks because some programs do not support quotation marks around the input file path. If
			you use an input path that contains spaces you might need to wrap it in quotation marks. Leave this empty if your
			executable does not require an input file.   	     
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4 id="output">Output</h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Output arguments</b>: First part for specifying output arguments. This is typically a <b>key word</b>
			that tells the executable that the specification of an output file will follow, e.g. "-output" or "-o". 
			Leave this empty if your executable does not require such an output key word.  
			</li>
			<li><b>Output file or folder</b>: Second part for specifying output arguments. This is typically the path
			to an output file or folder, e.g. "C:/output.txt". This path will not automatically be put in quotation marks 
			because some programs do not support quotation marks around the output file path. If you use an output path
			that contains spaces you might need to wrap it in quotation marks. Leave this empty if your executable 
			does not require an output file/folder.   	     
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4 id="outputModification" >Output modification</h4>
		
		<p>
		The <b>check boxes</b> in the output modification section allow to automatically modify the output file/folder that is
		specified above. This makes sense if you execute the <a class="executable"></a> atom many times, for example
		in a <a class="sweep"></a> study, and you want to have a <b>different output location for each execution</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		The check boxes allow you to include the <b>execution date</b> and or a <b>study index</b> (=increasing number). 
		You can append them to the name of the (parent) <b>folder</b>, the name of an extra <b>sub folder</b> or to the 
		<b>file name</b> by enabling the corresponding check boxes. If you use the output modification <b>please make
		sure</b> that your executable is able to automatically create the files/folders if they do not exist. 
		</p>
		<p>
		You can manually <b>reset the study index</b> with the orange button in the upper right corner of the property page. 
		If you remotely run the <a class="executable"></a> atom as part of a study, the <b>study index</b> will be reset
		at the start and then automatically increased while executing the study.       
		<p>
		<p>
		If you are not sure how the check boxes affect the system command, have a look the status section where a preview
		for the resulting system command is shown. The status section also shows the <b>study index</b> that will be used 
		for the next manual execution. (The actual <b>execution date</b> will be different to the date that is shown in the 
		preview and the study index might be overridden when remotely running the the <a class="executable"></a> atom as 
		part of a study.)  
		</p>
		
		
		<h4 id="logging">Logging</h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Log arguments</b>: First part for specifying logging arguments. This is typically a key word
			that tells the executable that the specification of a logging file will follow, e.g. "-log" or "-l". 
			Leave this empty if your executable does not require such a logging key word.  
			</li>
			<li><b>Log file</b>: Second part for specifying logging arguments. This is typically the path
			to a logging file, e.g. "C:/log.txt". This path will not automatically be put in quotation marks 
			because some programs do not support quotation marks around the logging file path. If you use a logging
			path that contains spaces you might need to wrap it in quotation marks.Leave this empty if your executable
			does not require a log file.   	     
			</li>
		</ul>
				
		<h3>Context menu</h3>
	
		The context menu allows to add new child atoms: 
		<ul>		
			<li><a class="inputFileGenerator"></a></li>
			<li><a class="tableImport"></a></li>		
		</ul>
